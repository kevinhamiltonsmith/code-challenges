# Spiral Sort an Array

Write a function that takes an n x n array as an input, and returns a flattened array with the items sorted from outermost elements to the inner element, in a spiral pattern.

To clarify:
```javascript
array = [[1,2,3,4],
         [6,6,7,5],
         [7,9,8,6],
         [8,9,8,7]]
spiral-sort(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,6,7,8,9]
```
