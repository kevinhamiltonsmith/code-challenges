# Reverse Words in a String

Write a function that takes a string as an input, and reverses the order of all of the words in that string. All consecutive non-whitespace characters are to be treated as individual words.

To clarify:
```javascript
reverseWords('Github is super amazing!') // amazing! super is Github
```
