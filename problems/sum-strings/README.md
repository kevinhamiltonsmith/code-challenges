# Sum Strings as Numbers

Given the string representations of two integers, return the string representation of the sum of those integers.

To clarify:
```javascript
sumStrings('1','2') // => '3'
```

A string representation of an integer will contain no characters besides the ten numerals "0" to "9".

Your solution must be able to handle large numbers. It should also remove leading zero's from the result.
